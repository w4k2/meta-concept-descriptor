## Experiment 4 â€“ Variance analysis and global metaatribute selection

The previous experiment aimed to select the most informative metaattributes for each stream, stream parameterization and replication (for synthetic and semi-synthetic), the source dataset (for semi-synthetic), and each fold. The aim of Experiment 4 is to analyze valuable metaattributes in the first place in three categories of stream origin, then the potential selection of a versatile collection of metafeatures that allow for effective identification of concepts for all streams.

In this experiment, the values of the F-statistic indicator of the ANOVA test were analyzed. F-statistic informs about the degree of linear dependence of a given attribute and the target label \citep{kim2017understanding}. As in the previous experiment, conclusions were drawn separately for three groups of streams (synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world). The evaluated F-statistics of the ANOVA test were determined for each type of stream and its replication.

The experiment aimed to select a group of metaattributes with high concept recognition capability for all three studied stream sources. In addition, the ability to classify using selected metaattributes was tested and compared to classification using a much larger, complete set of metafeatures.
