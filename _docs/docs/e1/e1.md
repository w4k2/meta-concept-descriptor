## Experiment 1 â€“ Chunk metafeature similarity with drifting concepts

This experiment aimed to verify whether the values expressing chunk metafeatures cluster into groups that would describe a single concept.

Streams were processed in batch mode. In the first experiment, the values of all analyzed metafeatures were calculated for each chunk of the generated data streams. The values from the entire stream course were examined. The expected result of the experiment was the grouping of metaattribute values in cohesive clusters depending on the current concept. In the case of streams with non-recurrent drift, metafeatures from adjacent chunks of data streams, unless a sudden drift has occurred, will lie close to each other in multidimensional space.
