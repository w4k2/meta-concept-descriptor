Five experiments conducted on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data streams examine the ability and potential of over 160 metaattributes from 9 categories to recognize concepts in non-stationary data streams. The work reveals the distinctions in the considered sources of streams and specifies 17 metafeatures with a high ability of concept identification.
