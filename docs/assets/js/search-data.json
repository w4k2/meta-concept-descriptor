Methods that actively process data streams use drift detectors, which performance is often based on monitoring the variability of different stream properties. This publication provides an overview and analysis of metafeatures variability describing data streams with concept drifts. Five experiments conducted on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data streams examine the ability and potential of over 160 metaattributes from 9 categories to recognize concepts in non-stationary data streams. The work reveals the distinctions in the considered sources of streams and specifies 17 metafeatures with a high ability of concept identification.
