## Experiment 3 â€“ Attribute selection

The third experiment aimed to analyze the performance of single metaattributes from promising categories in a recognition task.

In contrast to the second experiment, where disjoint groups of metaattributes were considered, in the third experiment, all metaattributes from categories previously considered promising were evaluated. Using the ANOVA F-test, the most informative features of each problem were selected. The considered number of metafeatures taken into account, starting with a single one and concluding with the analysis of the entire set of metafeatures. From this range, 29 values sampled from the space of a quadratic function were examined. As in a second experiment, the ability to assign a data chunk to a concept using selected metaattributes was tested. Similarly, three categories of streams were analyzed separately. For each repetition and each fold, the attributes taken into account in the classification were independently selected. The experiment was performed using a 5-times repeated 2-fold stratified cross-validation protocol.
