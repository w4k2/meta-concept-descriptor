## Experiment 5 â€“ Covariance analysis of selected metafeatures

The last experiment was aimed at analyzing the covariance of selected metaattributes. The experiment was divided into two parts -- the study of the covariance of the entire set describing the data stream, and the successive fragments of the stream in windows of 25 chunks. Both the covariance over the entire stream and the standard deviation of the covariance of features from successive windows were analyzed.

The experiment was to determine whether it was possible to exclude some of the analyzed measures based on their correlation. Reducing the number of metaattributes taken into account could, in practical applications, reduce the computational complexity of methods determining their values for the purpose of the concept identification task, without negatively affecting the quality of recognition. In this experiment, streams from three sources will be analyzed, which will allow determining differences and similarities in metaattribute values in changing concepts.
